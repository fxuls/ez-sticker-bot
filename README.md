## EzStickerBot

[@EzStickerBot](https://t.me/EzStickerBot) is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org) bot that can help users easily create their own stickers without ever needing to leave the app. EzStickerBot is also available in **__12 languages__**. See credits for all supported languages.

## Features
On Telegram stickers packs are created and managed through the official [@Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers) bot. After a user has created a pack [@Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers) prompts them to send stickers they want to add as file. The file must be no more than **512kb**, have one dimension equal to **512px** and the other of an equal or lower length, and be in **png** format.

EzStickerBot formats any image or file with an image extension sent to it to meet all three of these conditions so formatted file can be forwarded directly to [@Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers).

EzStickerBot will also format stickers sent to it so it can be used to get stickers as images to save to your device or to add to one of your packs.

## Contribute
Feedback and suggestions are welcome for both the user experience and the source itself. If you speak English and another language fluently and want to contribute to the project contact [@fxuls](https://t.me/fxuls) on Telegram. If you want to make monetary donation to help pay for the server costs that would also be extremely appreciated because EzStickerBot is currently running on a very shitty VPS because I can't afford better plans while I'm a student full time without a source of income.
